This is my personal research workspace for projects I develop during my PhD in [**Robotics at CINVESTAV Saltillo**](https://www.cinvestav.mx/saltillo).

- Created and maintained by [**Oscar Federico García Castro**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9uN1jh8AAAAJ).
- Focused on robotics, control, and intelligent systems.
- Used to organize code, experiments, and material related to my doctoral research.
- Intended to keep projects reproducible and easy to reuse.
- Open to collaboration with students and researchers interested in similar topics.

Important: this organization is a personal project and does not represent an official CINVESTAV unit.

Main topics that motivate the repositories in this organization:

- Intelligent control for robotic systems, manipulators, and mobile robots.
- Neural network based controllers and learning based control strategies.
- Wavelet analysis for signal processing, system identification, and fault detection.
- Robust and adaptive control for systems with uncertainty.
- Simulation and numerical experiments for validation.

Typical types of repositories:

- Core libraries for control, simulation, and identification.
- Experimental code for PhD and MSc research.
- Reproducible material for papers, theses, and talks.
- Utilities, templates, and small tools that support research workflows.

You can check the description of each repository to see its status, scope, and intended use.

I welcome:

- Issues and pull requests that fix bugs, improve code, or extend examples.
- Suggestions to improve documentation, tutorials, or reproducibility.
- Collaboration offers on robotics and intelligent control topics.
- Use of the code in theses, courses, or research projects, with proper citation.

If you want to collaborate, you can:

- Open an issue in a relevant repository.
- Fork a project and submit a pull request.
- Contact me through my main profile:
